# Daggerlib.js

Daggerlib.js acheives a Coffman-Graham style directed acycled graph via a resursive set reduction algorithm.  This allows for grouping the topological ordering of nodes into layers of ordinals instead of discrete ordinals.  With layered ordinals, you can perform parallel scheduling of tasks, render Sugiyama-style layered graphs, etc.  This is a refactoring of a C# version that first appeared in DsGraphEdit: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/21105/DSGraphEdit-A-Reasonable-Facsimile-of-Microsoft-s
